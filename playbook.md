# Report Playbook
Ideally, start this playbook at the end of the preceding quarter.

## Create a new report
To-do

## Projects
Projects are tracked [on a private Trello board](https://trello.com/b/wBKTQKDs/active-projects).

A project might live primarily on that Trello board,
or it could be something like an important GitHub issue.

Projects should have, at minimum, the following info:
```
NAME
START DATE
DUE DATE (default: ongoing)
TIMELINE:
- ddmmyyyy: event one
- ddmmyyyy: event two
```

## Data collection
Run scripts / visit URIs for the following:
* Important GitHub issues that might need attention
* Get *counts* of closed and open issues on GitHub
    * Both for this quarter and for past year, for comparison
* Network data: speed tests, node counts, monitor data, etc.
